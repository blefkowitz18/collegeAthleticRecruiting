# collegeAthleticRecruiting
project 3 UCF

There are thousands of high school athletes looking to pursue a career in athletics and looking to play their perspective sport at the next level (college). However, the old way of randomly posting videos on youtube or even sending videos via the USPS to colleges take a while to be noticed or even received.

My application will allow athletes to post profiles about themselves. These profiles will include information about the athlete that is only viewable by authorized college recruiters and the user who posted it, videos of the user, and or pictures of the user. 

This application will also have a log in for college athletic recruiters that will allow the recruiters to favorite athletes that they want to contact to play sports at their university.

That is an example of what will be created and the need for it.
